Open Source Hardware TDCS
=========================

Getting Started
---------------

If you've never used gEDA before, start with this simple
[tutorial](http://hobby-electrons.sourceforge.net/tutorials/gEDA/index.html). Once
you're familiar with the gschem and pcb UI feel free to clone the repo
in github with the [fork button](https://github.com/nocko/tdcs/fork)
or clone the repo using the CLI:

    git clone https://github.com/nocko/tdcs

Relevant files in the repo
--------------------------

tdcs.sch: 
        gschem schematic. Edit this file with *gschem* to add or
	remove components or change the way the components are
	connected.

board.pcb: 
	pcb layout. Edit with *pcb* to change the locations of the
	components on the board or to place new components added in
	gschem.

attrib:
	template files for the fields that should appear in a bill of
	materials file generated by *gnetlist*

project:
	gsch2pcb project file. Setup options to import tdcs.sch into
	board.pcb. Options like path to pcb footprints, names of
	schematics to process, and output name.

gafrc: 
       Options for gschem. Primarily the location of local schematic
       symbols

gerber/*:
	
	Gerber files generated from the *.pcb files. This directory is
	designed such that the contents can be compressed and sent to
	[OSH Park](http://oshpark.com/) without modification.

bom.txt:

	Bill of Materials, the components you need to buy to populate
	the board. Eventually this will auto generate via gnetlist,
	but for now the digikey part numbers are added manually.

Getting the PCB made
--------------------

I plan to add this to the wiki, but for now this
[post](https://nocko.se/2012/07/30/brain-zapping-is-fun/) is a good
starting point elaborated on slightly below:

 1. From the CLI:

     cd tdcs #In the repo directory
     zip tdcs gerber/* #creates tdcs.zip

 2. In a web browser: Browse to oshpark.com, select "Get Started Now",
then "Select a file on your computer". Select tdcs.zip created
above. Fill out the name, contact and billing information.

 3. Wait for boards to arrive
