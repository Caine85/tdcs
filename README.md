Open Source Hardware TDCS
=========================

Editing the project
-------------------

If you've never used gEDA before, start with this simple
[tutorial](http://hobby-electrons.sourceforge.net/tutorials/gEDA/index.html). Once
you're familiar with the gschem and pcb UI feel free to clone the repo
in github with the [fork button](https://github.com/nocko/tdcs/fork)
or clone the repo using the CLI:

    git clone https://github.com/nocko/tdcs

Getting the PCB made
--------------------

I plan to add this to the wiki, but for now this
[post](https://nocko.se/2012/07/30/brain-zapping-is-fun/) is a good
starting point.
